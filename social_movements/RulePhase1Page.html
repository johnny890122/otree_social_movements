            You will be placed in a network with other participants. (這邊待確認)
        </li>

        <li> 
            You need to decide how many participants (including yourself and your network neighbors) are needed for you to join the revolt. 
        </li>
    </ol>



    Example: If you set a threshold of 3, you will only join the revolt if at least 3 people (including yourself) participate. 
    <div class="mb-3 _formfield">
        <label class="col-form-label" for="id_test">
            How many people (including self) does it take to motivate a person to participate in the revolt?
        </label>
        <div class="controls">
            <select class="form-control" id="id_test" name="test" required>
                <option value="" disabled selected>Choose a threshold</option>
                <option value="1" disabled>1</option>
                <option value="2" disabled>2</option>
                <option value="3" >3</option>
                <option value="4" disabled>4</option>
            </select>
        </div>
